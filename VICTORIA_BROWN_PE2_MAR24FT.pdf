Reflection Project Exam 2 Victoria Brown

Contributions
As the developer for this Project I created the UI/UX design if Figma and implemented it in designing the webpage as well. Then implemented a React app using Vite and Typescript, including Bootstrap. 
Challenges
The most significant challenge was implementing Role-based authentication to distinguish between customer and venue manager user stories. I had to ensure only the venue manager could use the CRUD operations. So I solved this by using condition logic that checks the user's profile and login info, so then the UI only showed what was needed for the specific role.

Successes
I did the Lighthouse check in google, and initially had a very low score. So I fixed images, as they are usually the culprit because of their large sizes, by making them smaller and more compressed. This improved the loading status tremendously. 

Adaptations
During this project I managed to use my existing Front End skills to make a modern and responsive website. Instead of using Vanilla Javascript, Typescript was being used instead, also being a lot easier than Javacsript in my opinion. As well as naming all the function files correctly with CamelCase, and not lowercase naming. 

Personal highlights
I found it quite interesting to be able to use React in such ways, as I previously haven't used it that much. For example being able to render a calendar using React and implement booking and styling for it. I also really like styling and implementing toast notifications. It's just a small and simple step to do, but makes the site come alive.
